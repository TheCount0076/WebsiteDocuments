		<h2>Jack of all Suits</h2>
		<h3>Introduction and Game Setup</h3>
		<p>This game is an adaptation of the card game 500, and follows a more simpler version of the game whilst still being different to the original</p>
		<p>Made from a deck of 48 cards (all 2s and the black 3s removed and 2 jokers added) This game is suitable for 2 - 8 players.</p>
		<p>Before the first round starts each player in the game will agree on an acceptable number of cards to have, usually following the standard card amounts per catagory. The amount of cards decided will then be dealt to each player for the game to then start.</p>
		<p>Each player also starts with 1000 points to use during the game (these points can instead be money)</p>
		<br>

		<h3>How to Play</h3>
		<p>The player who dealt the cards will be known as "The Dealer" this role will move clockwise after each round unless a player reliquishes it to the next player of the round. The player who is the dealer of that round will choose a suit to be known as the "Round Suit". This suit will then be used to determine the value of each card in comparison to the next.</p>
		<p>Starting at the dealer each player will place a singular card face-down with the intent of placing the best card for the round</p>
