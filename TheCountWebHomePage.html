    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am The Count, through this website you can find out much about me and what I do here on Planet Earth.</p>
   
    <p>Starting off I like to make Dungeon and Dragons Campaigns for my own group! You can find many of them here on my site.
    <br>I also make Card Games that are mostly adaptations of pre-existing card games but there are a few original ones out there!
    <br>All of my campaigns and card games are free of use and free to modify yourself! On my campaign page you may leave reviews and comments on how to improve these campaigns for other users!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Dungeons And Dragons Page</h2>
    <p>On this page you will be able to find many of my campaigns and an indepth view into each one for absolutely free! I don't believe in charging people for an idea that was free for me to create
    <br>On this page you will be able to find these campaigns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Curse of The Cards</li>
        <li>A Debt Repaid</li>
    </ul>
